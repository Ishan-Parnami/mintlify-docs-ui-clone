# Mintlify Documentation Website Clone

This project is a desktop-first documentation-style website inspired by the Mintlify documentation platform. The objective of this assignment was to recreate the overall structure, layout, and content hierarchy of a modern documentation website using only HTML and CSS.

The focus of this implementation is on layout accuracy, readability, and visual consistency with the original Mintlify website.

## Project Overview

The website is a static, desktop-only documentation interface that mirrors the structure and layout of Mintlify’s documentation pages. No JavaScript, frameworks, or CSS libraries were used.

## Sections Implemented

The following sections were recreated as part of this assignment:

Top Navigation Bar with logo, navigation links, and primary call-to-action  
Hero Section with headline, description, email input, CTA button, and background illustration  
Documentation Preview Section with static sidebar navigation and content cards  
Trusted By section displaying company logos  
Feature Highlights using two-column text and visual layout  
Intelligent Assistant section with UI preview and description  
Enterprise Features section including security and compliance feature blocks  
Case Studies section with card-based customer stories  
Final Call-To-Action section with prominent heading and CTA buttons  
Footer with multi-column navigation links and company and legal information  

## Fonts and Colors

Fonts used in this project include Inter as the primary typeface with a sans-serif fallback.

The color palette is inspired by the Mintlify design system and includes dark background tones, light primary text, muted secondary text, and a blue accent color for calls-to-action.
